This is the story of a main character,
marked by an image of its childhood.

The violent scene which upset them,

and whose meaning
they were to grasp only years later,

happened on the main terminal at Dulles,
the Washington DC airport,

sometime before
the outbreak of War.

Dulles. Sunday.

Parents used to take their children
there to watch the departing planes.

On this particular Sunday,
the child whose story we are telling

was bound to remember the site of a frozen sun,

the setting at the end of the terminal,

and an avatar’s face.

Nothing sorts out memories
from ordinary moments.

Only afterwards do they claim remembrance
On the account of their scars.

That face they had seen was
to be the only peacetime
image to survive the war.

Had the main character really seen it?

Or had they invented that tender moment
to prop up the madness to come?

The sudden roar, the avatar’s gesture,

the crumpling body, and the
cries of the crowd on the
terminal blurred by fear.

Only later, the main character knew they had seen a plane hit.

And sometime after
came the war

Many died.

Some believed themselves
to be victors.

Others were taken prisoner.

The survivors settled beneath
the Financial district, in an underground
network of dreamhacks.

Above ground, the City, as most
of the world, was uninhabitable,

riddled with violence.

The victors stood guard
over an empire of rats.

The prisoners were
subjected to experiments,

apparently of great concern
to those who conducted them.

The outcome
was a disappointment for some

death for others

and for others yet, madness.

One day they came to select a new
guinea pig from among the prisoners.

It was the main character whose
story we are telling.

They were frightened.

They had heard about the
Head Experimenter and were prepared
to meet a Mad Scientist.

Instead, they met a reasonable man

who explained calmly that
the human race was doomed.

Space was off-limits.

The only link with survival
past through time.

A loophole in Time,

and then maybe
it would be possible to reach food,

medicine, energy.

This was the aim of the experiments:
to send emissaries into Time,

to summon the Past and Future
to the aid of the Present.

But the human mind balked

To wake up in another age
meant to be born again as an avatar.

The shock would be too much.

Having sent only lifeless or
insentient bodies through
different zones of Time,

the inventors where now
concentrating on subjects given
to very strong mental images.

If they were able to conceive
or dream another time,

perhaps would they be
able to live in it.

The data center admins spied even on dreams.

The main character was selected
from among a thousand

only because they were glued
to an image from the past.

Nothing else, at first,
but stripping out the
present

They start again.

The main character doesn’t die,
nor do they go mad.

The main character suffers.

They continue.

On the tenth day,
images begin to ooze,

like confessions.

A peacetime morning.

A peacetime bedroom,
a real bedroom.

Real children.

Real birds.

Real cats.

Real graves.

On the sixteenth day
The main character is on the terminal at Dulles.

Empty.

Sometimes they reach a day of happiness,
but another one

A face of happiness,
but another one.

Ruins.

An avatar who could be the one the main character is yearning for.

The main character passes it on the terminal.

Other images appear, merge,

in that museum,

which is perhaps that of his memory.

On the thirtieth day,
the meeting takes place.

Now The main character  is sure the avatar is the one-

In fact, it is
the only thing the main character is sure of,

in the middle
of this dateless world

that at first stuns them
with its affluence.

Around them,
only fabulous materials:

optical fiber, plastic, faux fur.

Once they recover from their trance,

the avatar is gone.

The experimenters
tighten their control.

They send the main character
back.

Time rolls back again,
the moment returns.

This time the main character is close to it,
they speak to it.

The avatar doesn't mind, it answers.

They are without memories,
without plans.

Time builds itself
painlessly around them.

Their only landmarks are the flavor
of the moment they are living

and the markings on the walls.

Later on, they are in a dark forest.

the main character remembers there were forests.

it asks  them about their necklace, 
a USB memory,

the combat necklace the main character wore
at the start of the war
that is yet to come.

They invent an explanation.

They walk. 

They look at the trunk
of a redwood tree covered
with historical dates.

The avatar pronounces an English name
the main character  doesn't understand.

As in a dream, they show it
a point beyond the tree,

hears themself say,

“This is where I come from…”

and falls back, exhausted.

Then another wave of Time
washes over the main character.

The result of
another server update perhaps.

Now the avatar is asleep in the sun.

the main character  knows that in this world
to which they have just
returned for a while,

only to be sent back to the avatar,

it is dead.

it wakes up.

The main character speaks again.

Of a truth too fantastic to be
believed they retain the meaning:

an unreachable country,
a long way to go.

the avatar listens.

it doesn't laugh.

Is it the same day?

The main character doesn't know.

They shall go on like this,
on countless walks in which
an unspoken trust,

an unadulterated trust
will grow between them,

without memories or plans.

Up to the moment where they feel
- ahead of them -

- a barrier.

And this was the end
of the first experiment.

It was the starting point for
a whole series of tests,

in which they would meet the avatar
at different times.

It welcomes them in a simple way.

The avatar calls them its Ghost.

One day it seems frightened.

One day it leans over the main character .

As for the main character, they never know
whether they move towards the avatar,

whether they are driven,
whether they have made it up,

or whether they are only dreaming.

Around the fiftieth day,

they meet in a museum
filled with timeless animals.

Now the aim is perfectly adjusted.

Thrown at the right moment, the main character may
stay there and move without effort.

The avatar too seems tamed.

It accepts as a digital phenomenon

the ways of this visitor
who comes and goes,

who exists, talks, laughs with it,

stops talking, listens to it,

then vanishes.

Once back in the experiment room,

The main character knew something was different.

The data center manager was there.

From the conversation around them,

the main character gathered that after the brilliant
results of the experiments in the Past,

they now meant to ship them
into the Future.

the main character’s excitement made them
forget for a moment that
the meeting at the museum

had been the last.

The future was better protected
than the Past.

After more, painful tries,

the main character eventually caught some waves
of the world to come.

they went through a brand new planet,

New York City rebuilt,

ten thousand
incomprehensible avenues.

Others were waiting for them.

It was a brief encounter.

Obviously, they rejected
these scoriae of another time.

The main character recited their lesson:

since humanity had survived,

it could not refuse to its own
past the means of its survival.

This sophism was taken for fate
in disguise.

They gave the main character a power unit
strong enough

to put all human industry
back into motion,

and again the gates of the Future
were closed.

Some time after his return,

the main character was transferred to
another part of the data center

they knew that their jailers
would not spare them.

the main character had been a tool in their hands,

their childhood image had been used
as bait to condition them,

they had lived up to their
expectations, the main character had
played their part.

Now they only waited
to be liquidated with,

somewhere inside them, the memory
of a twice-lived fragment of time.

And deep in this limbo,

they received a message from
the people of the world to come.

They too traveled through Time,

and more easily.

Now they were there,

ready to accept them
as one of their own.

But the main character had a different request:

rather than this pacified future,

they wanted the world of their childhood,

and this avatar who was
perhaps waiting for them.

Once again the main terminal at Dulles,

in the middle of this warm
pre-war Sunday afternoon
where they could now settle down,

the main character thought in a confused way
that the child they had been
was due to be there too,

watching the planes.

But first of all they looked
for the avatar’s face,
at the end of the terminal.

they ran toward the avatar.

And when they recognized the entity
who had trailed them since
the underground data center,

they knew there was no way
to escape time

and that this haunted image they had been
granted to see as a child,

which had never ceased to obsess them,

was the moment
