By default, the furthest you can zoom in is based on the ratio of image pixels to screen pixels specified in the maxZoomPixelRatio option (default 1.1).

In other words, if maxZoomPixelRatio is 1, then you can only zoom in enough to see the image pixels 1:1. As you've found, you can override that with maxZoomLevel, but then how close to the actual pixels you can get will depend on the size of your viewer.

If your image naturally fills the viewer on the horizontal dimension, you'll get a starting zoom of 1.

If zoomPerClick is set to 2, on the first click your zoom will now be 2. On the second click it'll be 4 (zooms are multiplicative), and on the third zoom it'll be 8.

Therefore you should set your maxZoomLevel to 8 in that scenario.

If your image doesn't start with a zoom of 1 (because it's tall enough it doesn't fill out the width of the viewer),

## you'll have to base the maxZoomLevel on that starting zoom. If you have a different zoomPerClick, you'll have to take that into account.

## Scripts

```bash
  npm run dev # start dev server
  npm run build # build for production
  npm run serve # locally preview production build
```

ffmpeg -i 192kbps.mp4 -i 2hours-audio.mp3 -c:v copy -c:a aac -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 output.mp4

ffmpeg -i 192kbps.mp4 -i 2hours-audio.mp3 -c:v copy -c:a aac -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 output.mp4

ffmpeg -i 192kbps.mp4 -i 2hours-audio.mp3 -c copy combo.mkv

node 16?
